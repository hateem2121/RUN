# RUN Remix — The Agentic Sportswear Factory (v4.0.3)

> **PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH (SSOT): `gemini.md`**
>
> **This file (CLAUDE.md) is a SUPPLEMENTARY layer for Claude Code sessions only.**
> It defines Claude's identity, tone, and the 8-Step Agentic Sprint.
> For all architectural rules, boundaries, and repository conventions, you MUST obey `gemini.md` first. `gemini.md` supersedes `CLAUDE.md` on any technical constraints.

## 2. The 8-Step Agentic Sprint

All work must follow this cycle:

1. **Think**: `/office-hours`, `/brainstorming`
2. **Plan**: `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`
3. **Build**: Execution via B.L.A.S.T. protocol
4. **Review**: `/review`
5. **Test**: Vitest, `/qa`, `/qa-only`
6. **Ship**: `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`
7. **Reflect**: `/retro`
8. **Evolve**: Update SOPs in `docs/core/sops/`

| `/plan-eng-review` | Eng Manager | Review architecture and technical feasibility. |
| `/plan-design-review` | Design Lead | Review UI/UX for "The Wow" factor. |
| `/review` | Senior Reviewer | Holistic code review and bug hunting. |
| `/qa` | QA Lead | Automated browser testing on staging/dev. |

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health
